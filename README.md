# Multitenancy subdomain

# Getting started

This application assumes you have at least Ruby, Postgres and other dependencies to run. 
If that is not the case you can use [kaishi] to install everything you need.

After setting up you can start using the application:

  % rails server

Or if you feel like using Foreman (comes with kaishi):

  % foreman start
